However, after the Six-Day War of 1967, French arms exports to Israel were terminated due to a change of Charles De Gaulle's cabinet's stance towards the Middle-Eastern situation. The 50 already finished Mirage 5s  were subject to that embargo too. This triggered the development of the Kfir.   They already had a license for the Mirage 5 airframe from Dassault. They added the Atar 9C engine to it, details of which they acquired through espionage.  This combination named Nesher  could be called a self-produced Mirage. However, the IAF wre unsatisfied with the performance  of the engine in high altitudes and high temperatures.   They decided to use the J79 engine of the American F-4E, already in IAF service. They also modified the airframe to improve performance, and applying  these changes to the Nesher resulted in the Kfir.   The Mirage III fitted with the J79 made its first flight in September 1970. The improved prototype of that, the Ra'am  took off first in June 1973. There were unconfirmed reports that a number of the original Mirage IIICs, re-engined with the J79 and given the name Barak , took part in the Yom Kippur War of 1973. The version optimized for the J79 entered service as the Kfir in April 1975, after the end of the conflict.   Since the J79 turbojet engine is a U.S design, although made in Israel, all export sales of the Kfir are subject to prior approval from the U.S. State  Department, a fact that has limited the sale of the Kfir to foreign nations. Before the introduction of the F-16N, the US Marine Corps leased a number of Kfirs and used them under the name of F-21 as aggressors. It was valued  for its ability to simulate the MiG-21 well.   It is already retired from IAF service, but a good number of them are still preserved, some sold to other countries after modernization refitting. The IAI relaunched Kfir production and CEO Joseph Weiss stated on 2014. April 3. that Argentina might be one of the new customers.   Features   Its appearance is much alike the Mirage 5, on which it was based. However, the J79's thrust is more than 2t over the Atar 9C, allowing for better  maneuverability and an extra 1.5t payload.   Using the J79 also required a major redesign of the airframe. The rear fuselage was slightly shortened and widened, its air intakes were enlarged,  and a large air inlet was installed at the base of the vertical stabilizer, so as to supply the extra cooling needed for the afterburner. The tail was  shortened by 0.6m for balancing reasons. it can, but the fuel consumption would be affected.",飛べますが燃費が変わってくるかな,I can fly but the fuel consumption will change,0.023904382470119518,0.13957824
