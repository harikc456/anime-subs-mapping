But think about it.  \h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hYou can say ""I'm home!"" if you live with your parents. \h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hYou can even buy some mouthwash and say \h\h\h\h\h\h""I'm home!"" to the hippos on the label. And \h\h\h\h\h\h\hif they're talking about seeing their sleeping \h\h\h\h\h\h\hkids, that just means they're working hellish  \h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hovertime hours. How is that in any way blissful? \h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hThey preach the joys of marriage, yet their eyes \h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hare as soulless as my own.
